FCFS disk-scheduling algorithms requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue. In this algorithm all requests are serviced sequentially but generally, it does not provide the fastest service.
In operating systems, seek time is very important. Since all device requests are linked in queues, the seek time is increased causing the system to slow down. Disk Scheduling Algorithms are used to reduce the total seek time of any request.
All incoming requests are placed at the end of the queue. Whatever number that is next in the queue will be the next number served. Using this algorithm doesn't provide the best results
